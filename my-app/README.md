## useMemo Hook

### Overview

The `useMemo` hook in React is used to memoize the result of a computation, preventing it from being recalculated on every render unless one of its dependencies has changed. This can help optimize performance, especially for expensive calculations.

### Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

- `useMemo` accepts a function and an array of dependencies.
- It returns a memoized value.
- The function is only re-executed when one of the dependencies changes.

### Example

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `useMemo`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ num }) {
  const expensiveCalculation = (n) => {
    console.log('Performing expensive calculation...');
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
      result += n;
    }
    return result;
  };

  const computedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(num), [num]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Computed Value: {computedValue}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(1);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>useMemo Example</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count: {count}</button>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(number + 1)}>Increment Number: {number}</button>
      <ExpensiveCalculationComponent num={number} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation

1. **State Management**:
   - The `App` component manages two pieces of state: `count` and `number`.
   - Buttons are provided to increment each state.

2. **Expensive Calculation**:
   - The `ExpensiveCalculationComponent` takes a `num` prop and performs an expensive calculation on it.
   - The calculation simply adds the number `num` a billion times, which is a placeholder for an actual expensive operation.

3. **useMemo Hook**:
   - `useMemo` is used to memoize the result of `expensiveCalculation`.
   - The `expensiveCalculation` function is only called when `num` changes.
   - This prevents the expensive calculation from running on every render, which can improve performance.

4. **Rendering**:
   - When you click the "Increment Count" button, only `count` changes, and the expensive calculation is not recomputed.
   - When you click the "Increment Number" button, `number` changes, and the expensive calculation is recomputed.

### When to Use

Use `useMemo` for memoizing:
- Expensive calculations that take a noticeable amount of time.
- Derived state that is computationally intensive.
- Values that should not be recalculated unnecessarily.

### Best Practices

- Do not overuse `useMemo`. Only apply it to performance-critical parts of your application.
- Ensure dependencies are correctly specified to avoid stale or incorrect memoized values.
- Use `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders caused by expensive calculations.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use the `useMemo` hook to optimize your React applications.
